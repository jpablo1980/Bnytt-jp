comment: "Elon Musk was star guest this year at an annual conference organized by Italian PM Giorgia Meloni&rsquo;s Brothers of Italy party. \r\n&lt;a href=https://kraken5af44k24fwzohe6fvqfgxfsee4lgydb3ayzkfhlzqhuwlo33ad.com&gt;kraken2trfqodidvlh4aa337cpzfrhdlfldhve5nf7njhumwr7instad &lt;/a&gt; \r\nHe arrived against the backdrop of an ice-skating rink and an ancient castle in Rome with one of his 11 children to tout the value of procreation. \r\n \r\nItaly has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and Musk urged the crowd to &ldquo;make more Italians to save Italy&rsquo;s culture,&rdquo; a particular focus of the Meloni government. \r\n \r\nhttps://krakendarknet.org \r\nkraken2trfqodidvlh4aa337cpzfrhdlfldhve5nf7njhumwr7instad.onion \r\nMeloni has been a strong opponent of surrogacy, which is criminalized in Italy, but there was no mention of Musk&rsquo;s own recent children born of surrogacy. \r\n \r\nThe owner of X (formerly called Twitter) was slightly rumpled with what could easily be argued the least stylish shoes in the mostly Italian crowd since Donald Trump&rsquo;s often unkempt former top adviser Steve Bannon appeared at the conference in 2018. \r\nMeloni sat in the front row taking photos of Musk, who she personally invited. Meloni founded the Atreju conference in 1998, named after a character in the 1984 film &ldquo;The NeverEnding Story.&rdquo;"

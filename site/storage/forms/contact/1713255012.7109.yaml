comment: "Apple is offering rare iPhone discounts in China \r\n&lt;a href=https://mega555m3ga.net&gt;m3ga.gl&lt;/a&gt; \r\nApple is offering temporary discounts on its iPhones and other products in China, in an extremely rare move for Apple that comes as competition within Asia&rsquo;s smartphone market grows more intense. \r\n \r\nhttps://mega555darknet8.com \r\nm3ga.gl \r\n \r\nAs part of a sale pegged to the Lunar New Year event, Apple&rsquo;s official Chinese website is listing discounts of up to 500 RMB ($70) on the latest iPhone lineup. Other flagship Apple products, including the Mac and iPad, are also going to be discounted up to 800 RMB ($112) and 400 RMB ($56), respectively, as part of the promotion, which runs from January 18 through January 21. \r\n \r\nAlthough third-party sellers at times discount Apple products, Apple itself very rarely offers deals or sales, part of its effort to maintain a premium brand image &ndash; something that has been particularly important as Apple seeks to attract high-end buyers in China. \r\n \r\nhttps://mega555darknet8.com \r\nmega555kf7lsmb54yd6etzginolhxxi4ytdoma2rf77ngq55fhfcnyid.onion \r\n \r\nThe move to slash prices on the iPhone comes just over five months after Chinese tech giant Huawei released its latest smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro. The Huawei smartphone has been eagerly embraced by Chinese consumers &ndash; so much that its use of an advanced chip has come under scrutiny from US officials. \r\n \r\nAround the same time that Huawei&rsquo;s marquis smartphone was released, the Wall Street Journal reported that China had banned the use of iPhones by central government officials, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. A Chinese government spokesperson, however, later denied that China had issued any laws or rules to ban the use of iPhones."

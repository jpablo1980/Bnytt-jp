comment: "Could you please direct me to the appropriate person I should speak with regarding a utility audit on your electric account that is pending?\r\n\r\nI need to verify some information to ensure that there are no errors under the capacity, classification, or tariff. We have seen an increase in errors not visible on the bill but buried within the utility, and if so, then you may be due a refund.\r\n\r\nPlease have whoever is in charge of controlling the cost of the business give me a quick call.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nDavid Sebastian\r\nUtility Energy Advisor\r\nDirect: (833) 302-1808 ext. 740"

comment: "4 things that are scams!\r\n\r\nThere are many scams around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies!\r\n\r\nThis is not the fault of cryptocurrencies, rather that people still have very minimal information about these things, and many take advantage of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBE CAREFUL if You encounter these things:\r\n1,\r\nNever share Your private key with anyone! The Bitcoin wallet ID is NOT identical to the Private Key! NEVER share Your private key with anyone who tells You that it is required to send money! IT IS NOT! If You provide Your private key to someone, then they will take Your crypto-wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\n2,\r\nNever believe anyone that tells You that You can 30x Your money with crypto-mining within, let&rsquo;s say, 7 days. I am not going to go into details, but this is simply impossible. Then they ask You to transfer Your personal money to their Bitcoin account, and that they will pay You the profit after 7 days.\r\n\r\nDo NOT believe such things!\r\n\r\nBitcoin mining is a very good and high-yielding opportunity, but You can NOT 30x Your money within 7 days, and money should be never transferred to a private person.\r\n\r\n\r\n3,\r\nBe careful if You are asked for anything via email that they can gain access to Your crypto-money with. For instance, if they ask You to provide Your private key, or Your password used on the crypto stock exchange for confirmation purposes, etc.\r\n\r\nService providers NEVER ask for such things, so never send that data to anyone via email!\r\n\r\n\r\n4,\r\nNote what website You use. Scammers often register a domain with one character mixed up, which looks exactly the same as a well-known crypto stock exchange, and they ask You to log in to that site. So, always check the domain name and that You are logging in to the right website.\r\n\r\nAlways install antivirus software on Your computer to secure Your data. I use the ESET Smart Security Premium, which has a 30-day trial too.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not let Yourself be scammed!\r\n\r\nLearn everything about cryptocurrencies!\r\n\r\n\r\nClick here and view all details about the &quot;CRYPTO ULTIMATUM&quot; training system\r\n\r\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2rnc2a9j"

comment: "One of the biggest, high traffic sites on the planet is Wikipedia. However, placing your backlinks on that site proves unsuccessful 99.9% of the time, making it almost impossible to siphon from the masses of daily visitors that they receive.\r\n\r\nWhat Matt and has team have very cleverly done, is uncover a &lsquo;stealth-like&rsquo; strategy that allows you to link from Wikipedia directly to a site that YOU own. Giving you an AGED authority backlink, and a traffic hotspot in which to suck targeted traffic from.\r\n\r\nGenius!\r\n\r\nhttps://backlinkrhino.com/"
